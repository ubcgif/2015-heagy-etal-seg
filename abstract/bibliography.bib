abstract = {Abstract The Eagle Ford shale is a hydrocarbon-producing formation of significant importance due to its capability for producing at high-liquid/gas ratios, more so than other traditional shale plays. Situated in south Texas, the total Eagle Ford liquids production in 2007 was less than 21,000 bbl total. In 2011, production averaged 65,500 BOPD in the play (EIA, 2011). Activity in the Eagle Ford continues to increase because the benefits from producing high liquid yields across much of the play, along with attractive commodity prices, have made the Eagle Ford a more attractive development over many other shale reservoirs. The rapid development of the Eagle Ford shale was enabled by horizontal drilling. In 2007 none of the reported production was from horizontal wells. In 2011 alone over 2,800 drilling permits were issued, virtually all of them for horizontal wells (RigData, 2012). The Eagle Ford shale has low-clay content, high-carbonate content, and is in an extensional basin, making it conducive to somewhat complex hydraulic fracturing (Martin et al, 2011). The plug and perforating technique has become the preferred completion method in the play due to multiple entry points creating complex fractures at a minimal cost. This completion technique requires a mechanical means for conveying perforating guns, such as coiled tubing (CT), wireline tractor or stick pipe, for the first fracturing stage at the toe of the well. To streamline their completion process, an Eagle Ford operator chose to use an initiator valve that is run at the toe of the well as part of the final completion design. This pressure activated valve is capable of initiating operations on the first fracturing stage without the need for CT or other mechanical means of conveyance of perforating guns. Simple and robust, the valve is activated by a pressure increase from the surface. The valve uses a rupture disc for precise activation and a helical port design that allows for hydraulic fracturing to be performed through the valve into the cement and the formation. With over a dozen wells completed in the Eagle Ford formation by the operator, the valve has provided logistical and economic benefits to the streamlined completion process. This paper describes the initiator valve completion tool and its application in the Eagle Ford shale. A case history is presented to show the specific design and operation of the initiator valve, as well as its benefits over other completion practices that target the first stage in a closed lateral system. Detailed activation of the valve and fracturing data through the valve are also presented. Introduction Tight economics in many onshore North American unconventional oil and gas plays has made it important for operators in such reservoirs to maximize economics as much as possible. One way to aid in maximizing the economics is through the use of improved drilling and completion techniques and cost control; one such method is to eliminate interventions during the well completion process. Every time a tool is run in the hole, the total cost of the well increases. One costly intervention that can be eliminated is the initial perforating run on the first stage of a cemented lateral well. During this operation, the well is a closed system which prevents the plug and gun assembly from being pumped to the toe of the lateral. To address this inefficiency a costly, timely, and in some cases risky CT, stick pipe, or wireline tractor run must be used to convey the guns into the lateral which is a closed system. A novel valve was developed to initiate the fracturing process in horizontal cemented wells. The process eliminates the intervention historically used to perforate the first stage. The initiator valve is a pressure-activated valve installed as part of the casing string placed at the toe stage of the well. The valve, cemented in place and requiring no changes to the cement operation or chemistry, is pressure activated and once the sliding sleeve in the valve is opened, the wellbore fluid is exposed to the cement sheath in the annular space. At this point the fracturing operation can begin. Once the first stage is complete, lower cost pump down plug and perf operations can begin.},

abstract = {Pipe corrosion is a natural phenomenon in the harsh environment of oil and gas production wells, costing billions of dollars each year. Monitoring such corrosion allows for timely mitigation to prevent leaks, environmental damage, or catastrophic failures. Corrosion of pipes is inferred from measurement of internal diameter and wall thickness. Mechanical finger calipers provide a high-resolution image of the internal pipe surface. Ultrasonic tools measure both the internal diameter and thickness of a single pipe, providing the pipe is filled with a fluid. Production tubing is a barrier to caliper, ultrasonic, and flux-leakage electromagnetic tools, preventing the assessment of outer casings. Remote-Field Eddy-Current (RFEC) tools respond to the total metal thickness of all the combined casings. The measurement is valid in single and multiple casing strings and is largely insensitive to the kind of material filling the pipe. This paper presents a new slim electromagnetic (EM) imaging tool enabling casing assessment without removing the production tubing. The tool excites eddy-currents in the tubulars using a powerful low-frequency solenoidal transmitter. Distribution and strength of the eddy-currents depend on the geometric properties of the casings, their EM properties, and the presence of defects. The tool operates in the RFEC regime using large transmitter-receiver spacings, in which the measurements directly determine the total metal thickness. Mandrel-mounted coils provide the average total metal thickness, and eighteen small pad sensors around the tool provide an image of local pipe wall metal loss. The combination of low- and high-frequency images, together with the average total metal thickness, provides a quantitative, high-resolution assessment of pipe condition. Log examples show detection of casing joints, additional casings strings, and presence of corrosion damage in the low- and high-frequency images.

abstract = {Microseismic monitoring (MSM) of hydraulic fracture treatments is routine in North America and has added significantly to our understanding of fracture growth. The interpretation of microseismic images is advancing steadily, extracting more information from event patterns, temporal evolution, and acoustic waveforms. The increasing amount of information from MSM provides significant opportunities to improve stimulation designs, completion strategies, and field development. However, the applications of microseismic interpretations are many times ill-defined, overlooked, or not applied properly. Numerous applications of microseismic measurements have been documented in technical publications, typically in the form of case histories focused on specific applications. The industry has lacked a compilation and comprehensive discussion of microseismic applications. This paper presents a practical guide for the engineering application of microseismic interpretations, documenting reliable application workflows while highlighting the consequences of misapplication of microseismic interpretations. The application of MSM starts with a reliable interpretation of fracture geometry and complexity, but the real value is in the application of the interpretation. This paper divides microseismic applications into three categories, real-time, completion strategies \& stimulation design, and field development. The MSM interpretation requirements for each category are documented and a comprehensive guide to properly applying these interpretations is presented. Applications issues such as determining the "effective?? fracture surface area, the relationship between microseismic behavior and well performance, and fracture model calibration are addressed. There is a growing interest in advanced processing such as moment tensor inversion (MTI) and b-values to determine focal mechanisms, source parameters, and failure mechanisms associated with the microseismic events. However, the engineering application of these interpretations is not well understood. This paper includes a discussion of the applications of advanced processing results, emphasizing how the limitations and uncertainties of the processing affect the subsequent applications.},

abstract = {Thousands of hydraulic fracture treatments have been monitored in the past ten years using microseismic mapping, providing a wealth of measurements that show a surprising degree of diversity in event patterns. Interpreting the microseismic data to determine the geometry and complexity of hydraulic fractures continues to be focused on visualization of the event patterns and qualitative estimates of the “stimulated volume”, which has led to wide variations and inconsistencies in interpretations. Comparing the energy input during a hydraulic fracture treatment and resultant energy released by microseismic events demonstrates that the seismic deformation is a very small portion of the total deformation. The vast majority of the energy is consumed in aseismic deformation (tensile opening) and fluid friction (Maxwell et al. 2008). Proper interpretation of microseismic measurements should account for both seismic and aseismic deformation, coupling the geomechanics of fracture opening and propagation with the shear failures that generate microseisms. Interpretation of microseismic measurements begins with an evaluation of location uncertainty, using signal-to-noise ratios and error ellipsoids, along with event moment magnitude. In some cases, microseismic event location uncertainty is erroneously interpreted as fracture complexity. The next step is to normalize the data and correct for observation well bias, both distance and azimuth, including use of seismic radiation patterns. Without these corrections fracture behavior from well to well or stage to stage (especially in horizontal wells) can easily be misinterpreted. Advanced geophysical processing that describes the failure mechanisms in more detail may also aid in the interpretation. The final step in the interpretation is to include the geomechanics of the overall process, accounting for the fracture treatment volumes injected, the net pressure in the hydraulic fracture(s) and the shear failures that generated the microseisms. This final, critical step is often overlooked when interpreting microseismic measurements. The paper provides a comprehensive, yet practical guide to the interpretation of microseismic measurements.},

abstract = {In recent years, there have been numerous advances in fracture mapping/diagnostic technologies. This paper details the state of the art technologies in applying both conventional and advanced methods to better understand hydraulic Fracturing and improve treatment designs. The initial portion of the paper describes the application and limitations of various diagnostic tools and methods, including well testing, net pressure analysis (fracture modeling), techniques that employ open- and cased-hole logs, surface- and downhole-tilt fracture mapping, microseismic fracture mapping, and production-data analysis. The bulk of the paper is dedicated to case histories that illustrate the application of these fracture-diagnostic technologies. The case histories include examples of how several fracture diagnostics can be used in concert to provide more reliable estimates of fracture dimensions and allow better economic decisions.},

abstract = {Frequency and time-domain analytical expressions are derived for the electromagnetic field response of a resistive layer inserted in an otherwise homogeneous whole-space as observed in the vicinity of an electric dipole source. The analysis of closed-form solutions demonstrated that at near-source-receiver offsets, the spectral and spatial distribution of the fields is better described by a superposition of images, associated with the dipolar character of the charges distributed in the boundaries, rather than the guided mode behavior dominating the response in the far offset regime. Approximate solutions of the fields in the frequency domain were derived using the saddle point method of integration. The formulas describing the fields were in good agreement with semianalytical calculations. However, a lower frequency bound was found, below which the expressions are inaccurate, and thereby they cannot be used to obtain time-domain solutions. A kernel modulation scheme was used instead, which yields an infinite series representation for the fields. The expressions thus derived produce accurate fields to very low frequencies, and thereby they were also used to obtain time-domain formulas. The analysis indicated that for a vertical electric dipole (VED) excitation, the late time response of the image field associated with the charge density induced on the upper boundary appears to cancel the direct field, thus providing the response of the layer. For a horizontal electric dipole (HED) source, the superimposed contributions of the transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes appeared to oppose the image field, resulting in the direct field dominating over the response of the layer, and thereby masking any sensitivity to the properties of the layer in this configuration.},

abstract = {The inversion of large-scale magnetic data sets has historically been
successfully achieved through integral transforms of the large, dense
sensitivity matrix. Two well-known transforms, the discrete Fourier
and multi-dimensional wavelet, reduce the required storage and ultimately
speed of the inversion by storing only the necessary transform coefficients
without losing accuracy. The main drawback of the approaches is the
required calculation of the entire dense sensitivity matrix prior
to the transform. This process can be much more costly than the inversion
itself. We solve the magnetostatic Maxwell's equation using a finite
volume technique on an ocTree-based mesh. The ocTree mesh greatly
reduces the time required for the inversion process. When working
in the differential equation domain it is not necessary to explicitly
form the sensitivity matrix; this decreases the storage requirement
of the problem and increases the overall speed of the inversion.
The principal mesh is broken up into sub-domain ocTree grids to further
enable parallelization of the forward problem. These grids extend
the entire domain of the principal mesh to include large regional
features that may influence the data. We present the discretization
of the equations and verify the accuracy of the modelling both with
the principal mesh and with multiple sub-domains. We show a synthetic
example and a large field example consisting of over 4 million data
and 5 million model cells that was inverted on a desktop computer.},

These basis functions give a representation of the electric field that is divergence free but not curl free within a cell, and whose tangential component is continuous between cells.

abstract = {It is well known that in economics and finance, the data usually have “fat tail” and in this case the Normal distribution is not a good model to use. The skew normal distributions recently draw considerable attention as an alternative model. Unfortunately, the distribution of the sum of log-skew normal random variables does not have a closed form. In this work, we discuss the use of lower convex order of random variables to approximate this distribution. Further, two application of this approximate distribution are given : first to describe the final wealth of a series of payments, and second to describe the present value of a series of payments.},

@article{He2012,
abstract = {Hydraulic fracturing is widely used for initiating and subsequently propagating fractures in reservoir strata by means of a pressurized fluid to release oil and gas or to store industry waste. Downhole or surface microseismic monitoring is commonly used to characterize the hydraulically induced fractures. However, in some cases, downhole microseismic monitoring can be difficult due to the limitation imposed by boreholes. Surface microseismic monitoring often faces difficulties acquiring high signal-to-noise ratio data because of the on-site noise from hydraulic fracturing process. Research and field observations indicate that injecting conductive slurry or water into a strata may generate distinct time-lapse electromagnetic anomalies between pre- and posthydraulic fracturing. These anomalies provide a means for characterizing the hydraulic fracturing using time-lapse electromagnetic methods. We examined the time-lapse variation over an hour, one day, one month, and two years of observed audio-magnetotellurics (AMT) resistivity and the 1D and 3D AMT modeling result of the variation pre- and posthydraulic fracturing. There is also a successful case history of applying the time-lapse AMT to map hydraulic fractures. Observed data indicate that the variation of AMT resistivity is normally less than 6\% apart from the data of the dead band and some noisy data. Modeling results show the variation pre- and posthydraulic fracturing is larger than 30\% at the frequency point lower than 100 Hz. The case history indicates that time-lapse magnetotelluric monitoring may form a new way to characterize the hydraulic fracture.},

abstract = {Electrical logging in cased holes is a subject of strong current interest. In this paper we develop the conventional theory of physical responses of electrical logging through casing where the formation resistivity changes vertically and where the conductance of the casing varies. The theory is developed for a four-electrode sonde with one current electrode, and three receiver electrodes that measure current leakage into the formation. All the theoretical developments in the paper are derived using approximate transmission-line theory. An expression for the array coefficient is first derived and then used to obtain an expression for the apparent conductivity of the formation. Then a relation is established between the array coefficient, geometrical factor and conductance of the casing. This step led to a method of measuring casing conductance. Knowing casing conductance, the response of the array to vertical changes in formation conductivity is measurable. It was established, that when the array length is less than the thickness of the formation layer, the measured apparent conductivity is equivalent to the true conductivity of the formation, unlike the case of normal and induction logs. It was also established that measurement of apparent conductivity can be made accurately inside a casing of finite length when it essentially exceeds the length of the electrode array. The results contained in this paper show that electrical logging through casing is possible in wells with conventional casing strings that penetrate layered sedimentary formations.},

abstract = {The first Borehole to Surface Electromagnetic (BSEM) pilot field survey in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) was successfully executed to identify oil and water bearing reservoir layers in a carbonate oilfield water injection zone. Maximizing recovery factor by means of detailed mapping of hydrocarbon accumulations in the reservoirs is a key requirement for oil producing companies. This mapping is done routinely by accurate measurements of fluid distribution at the wells’ locations, but a knowledge gap exists in the inter-well volumes, where typically only density-based measurements are available (seismic and gravity). Such technologies are not always effective to discriminate and quantify the fluids in the porous space (especially when difference in fluid densities is small, such as oil and water). On the contrary, when high electrical resistivity contrasts exist between hydrocarbons and water, electromagnetic (EM) based technologies have the potential to map the distribution of the fluids and monitor their movement during the life of the field, hundreds of meters or kilometers away from the wellbores. The objective of a BSEM survey is to obtain fluid sensitive resistivity and induced polarization maps. These are based on an acquisition grid at the surface, a few kilometers around the EM transmitting well, which reveal oil and water bearing zones in the investigated reservoir layers. In this pilot field test, BSEM showed the potential to map water-front movements in an area of about 4km from the single well surveyed, evaluate the sweep efficiency, identify bypassed/ lagged oil zones, and eventually monitor the fluid displacements, if surveys are repeated over time. The data quality of the recorded signals is highly satisfactory. Fluid distribution maps obtained with BSEM are coherent with production data measured at the wells’ locations, filling the knowledge gap of the inter- wells area. Three key R\&D objectives for this BSEM pilot are achieved. Firstly, the capability to record at the surface EM signals generated in the reservoir, secondly, the capability of BSEM to discriminate between oil and water saturated reservoir zones, and finally obtain resistivity maps and a fluid distribution estimate plausible and coherent with the information obtained from well logs, crosswell EM, production data and reservoir models. In addition to reservoir monitoring, BSEM can be very useful in non-diagnosed areas like exploration fields for hydrocarbon exploitations.},

It is proved that for strictly convex problems the algorithm converges to the solution, and that if the solution is nondegenerate, then the algorithm terminates at the solution in a finite number of steps. Numerical results are presented for the obstacle problem, the elastic-plastic torsion problem, and the journal bearing problems. On a selection of these problems with dimensions ranging from 5000 to 15,000, the algorithm determines the solution in fewer than 15 iterations, and with a small number of function-gradient evaluations and Hessian-vector products per iteration.},

abstract = {Linear inverse theory is used to deconvolve a data set when the blurring$\backslash$nfunction or source wavelet is (approximately) known. Rather than$\backslash$nattempting to find one of infinitely many models which fits the data$\backslash$nthis paper uses the methods of Backus and Gilbert to generate localized$\backslash$naverages of the model which are unique except for a statistical uncertainty$\backslash$ncaused by errors in the data. The averages, their statistical error$\backslash$nand the associated averaging window completely codify our knowledge$\backslash$nabout the model. Averages with lower standard deviations can be had$\backslash$nby sacrificing resolution and the investigator is free to choose$\backslash$nthose results which are most meaningful. Moreover, this method is$\backslash$noptimum in the sense that no other averaging window can be constructed$\backslash$nwhich has greater resolving power and yet produces averages with$\backslash$nthe same statistical accuracy. Our deconvolution method in the time$\backslash$ndomain is shown to be very similar to finding the inverse filter$\backslash$nof the source wavelet, and indeed the averaging window is simply$\backslash$nthe convolution of these two functions. However, by investigating$\backslash$nthe trade-off between resolution and accuracy we have shown that$\backslash$nthe data errors can be much more important than the parameters of$\backslash$nthe Wiener optimum inverse filter such as the length of that filter$\backslash$nand the desired location of the output spike. In the frequency domain$\backslash$nthe equations for trading off accuracy and resolution have been developed$\backslash$nand the computations are seen particularly to be simple because no$\backslash$nmatrix inversion is required. Sufficient examples will be presented$\backslash$nto show the importance of incorporating the observational errors$\backslash$ninto the deconvolution procedure. Additionally, we have shown how$\backslash$nto reduce the sidelobes of the averaging windows by shaping them$\backslash$ninto Gaussian functions of a predetermined width, have looked at$\backslash$nthe effects of using a zero area source function characteristic of$\backslash$nseismic problems, and have attempted a deconvolution when the wavelet$\backslash$nwas only approximately known. The frequency domain deconvolution$\backslash$nfilter derived here is also compared quantitatively with those derived$\backslash$nintuitively by Helmberger and Wiggins and Deregoiwski. Lastly, we$\backslash$nshow how information in the averages and averaging windows can be$\backslash$nused to construct a parametric model, composed of a series of delta$\backslash$nfunctions, which fits the data. Such a model is of importance in$\backslash$nseismological and spectroscopic studies.},

The method is based on mathematically modelling the physical response of a system to external excitation over a range of frequencies. The response amplitudes are then used to determine the resonant frequencies. So, contrary to the traditional scheme, the method described does not involve evaluation of determinants of linear systems. The solution of an eigenvalue problem is reduced to a sequence of inhomogeneous problems with the differential operator studied. The method shows a high precision in simply and multiply connected domains. The results of the numerical experiments justifying the method are presented. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Unexpected borehole measurements are often inaccurately interpreted due to limited knowledge of the formation, particularly in tight-gas unconventional reservoirs. A novel method was applied to determine reservoir quality and the reliability of borehole array-induction resistivity measurements in a tight gas sandstone reservoir. Four exploration wells drilled with synthetic oil-based mud showed conflicting resistivity profiles. The discovery well showed a conductive invasion profile, but the appraisal wells showed resistive profiles. Simulation of oil-based mud-filtrate invasion was coupled with forward simulation and inversion of array-induction resistivity measurements to determine the difference in such resistivity profiles. Laboratory measurements on rock core and fluid samples were used to calibrate a log-based petrophysical model that was necessary to simulate the physics of fluid-flow mud-filtrate invasion. The dynamic process of invasion was simulated with a multicomponent formulation for the hydrocarbon phase and rock wettability alteration effects due to surfactants present in the mud. Simulated borehole-resistivity measurements were compared to field logs, and the rock properties were modified to secure a close agreement between simulated and field logs. The different invasion profiles corresponded to variable rock quality and mud composition. In the discovery well, good rock quality and thick surfactants in the mud caused a low mobility ratio between filtrate and native fluids, which created a water bank that moved ahead into the formation. This effect created a conductive annulus in the near-wellbore region. In turn, the deep invasion and high resistivity are due to excellent rock quality that is typical of a conventional sandstone reservoir. The shallower invasion and resistive profiles in the delineation wells suggest the tight gas sandstone reservoir we expected to find throughout the formation.},

In batteries, energy density is also of concern, and can be augmented by increasing the volume fraction of active material. However, greater volume fraction means less porosity, and so lower conductivity and reduced power density. Understanding this balance requires a model of conductivity in composite materials.

abstract = {The shale gas boom, the recent and rapid commercialization of large-scale shale gas production, has made the us self-sufficient in natural gas and has considerable export potential. Gas is set to become the biggest fuel in the us energy mix and has helped the us to curb its greenhouse gas emissions. Cheap gas is also reinforcing the trend of rising industry investment in the us. • The impacts of the us shale gas boom are already being felt in Europe and Asia, for example via cheaper coal. The ‘coal renaissance’ in Europe can still be avoided either by a carbon price or other forms of regulation. Restoring the ability of the European Emissions Trading System to guide investments is the best solution, and can be done simply by setting an adequate emissions cap for the post-2020 period. • Globally, the rise of unconventional fossil energy sources means that the energy markets of the coming decades will move towards a more competitive and fragmented order, in which many energy importing countries also utilize significant domestic resources, and are able to balance their imports with regional exporters and the major global players. • These developments point to a weakening Russian grip on the European gas market, and problems for Russian export revenues in general. Other states lag far behind the us in shale gas technology, but will try to replicate the us experiment, while Russia will strive to prevent this from happening in its neighbourhood.

abstract = {Most wells in oil fields are cased with metal. The feasibility of measuring low-frequency magnetic fields through such steel-cased wells is of great interest for monitoring fluid movement during production. We report on experimental and modeling results regarding the effect of steel casing on electromagnetic signals transmitted through them. This effect includes the attenuation and phase shift of a signal diffusing through the casing wall. Sample casings are studied under low field strength in the linear regime where the casing’s electrical properties are independent of the applied signals. Frequency spectra are measured for transverse-electric and transverse-magnetic polariza- tions from 0.1 Hz to 1 kHz. Numerical models, devel- oped to simulate the casing response, match the ex- perimental data very well. Finally, studies of the effects of the earth’s magnetic field and casing rema- nent magnetization show that these steady biases do not affect the ac signal detection.},

abstract = {The mathematical formulation of acoustic diffraction tomography is applied to the problem of low frequency, diffusive electromagnetic (EM) fields. EM tomographic inversion, in two-dimensional (2-D) Cartesian geometry, is illustrated for a crosshole sourcereceiver configuration. The object function of the conductivity distribution is related to the transformed and filtered data by an inverse Fourier transform in the vertical direction and an inverse Laplace transform in the lateral direction. The reconstructed conductivity image is found to be a band-limited version of the actual conductivity distribution. To stabilize the inversion, a regularized least-squares method is used for image reconstruction. As in the seismic case, the inversion quality can be understood by inspecting the wavenumber domain coverage of the object function. Numerical experiments show that the resolution is better in the vertical direction than in the horizontal and it is also a function of source operating frequency. The position and attitude of the target are recovered well.},

abstract = {The mathematical formulation of acoustic diffraction tomography is applied to the problem of low frequency, diffusive electromagnetic (EM) fields. EM tomographic inversion, in two-dimensional (2-D) Cartesian geometry, is illustrated for a crosshole sourcereceiver configuration. The object function of the conductivity distribution is related to the transformed and filtered data by an inverse Fourier transform in the vertical direction and an inverse Laplace transform in the lateral direction. The reconstructed conductivity image is found to be a band-limited version of the actual conductivity distribution. To stabilize the inversion, a regularized least-squares method is used for image reconstruction. As in the seismic case, the inversion quality can be understood by inspecting the wavenumber domain coverage of the object function. Numerical experiments show that the resolution is better in the vertical direction than in the horizontal and it is also a function of source operating frequency. The position and attitude of the target are recovered well.},
